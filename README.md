This project was developed over a few hours during any downtime I got while in college. It is a simple [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) clone made from scratch using C# and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) (using the [Raylib-cs bindings](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs))

# Compile and run

To run this project, get .NET 8.0, and then simply run `dotnet run`, the game should start with no extra setup required.
